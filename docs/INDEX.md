# Documentation Index

> Last updated: 2026-03-06

This directory contains both AI-readable reference docs (UPPERCASE files) and developer-authored deep-dives (lowercase files). Start with OVERVIEW.md for a high-level understanding.

## Reading Order for New Agents

1. **[OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md)** — What Pilot is, tech stack, key concepts, entry points
2. **[STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md)** — Where things live in the codebase and module boundaries
3. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — How components connect, data flows, key abstractions
4. **[GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md)** — Domain terminology (read when a term is unclear)
5. **[DATA_MODEL.md](DATA_MODEL.md)** — Types, file-based persistence, settings schemas
6. **[PATTERNS.md](PATTERNS.md)** — Coding conventions to follow when writing new code
7. **[CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md)** — All config knobs, defaults, and file locations
